# Simple_Perceptron

In the code "numeros.py" we have an image database where the pixels that 
are 784 pixels are analyzed to obtain which number is the corresponding one 
for image detection without using convolutional networks.

In the following programs simple perceptrons are usedusing the threshold 
activation function.
